# Sim_muEDM_EntranceDet
Entrance detector simulation for muEDM with Geant4-based musrSim.\
These simulations study the entrance detector performance and evaluates beam test measurement results.\
- **`100masterWithAPD.mac`**: macro file containing instrument setup information
- `visVRML.mac`: macro file outputting `.wrl` for event display
- `*.stl`: AUTOCAD files for rack and holder geometries

# Spring 2023
### Simulation of prototype telescope (veto) detector 
To reproduce detector measruements from PSI Beam Test 2022.
- Detector geometry based on beam test
- Optical photons collected with four sensitive device volumes attached to the rear end of the scintillator blocks
- Optical boundary processes are being defined between each surfaces
